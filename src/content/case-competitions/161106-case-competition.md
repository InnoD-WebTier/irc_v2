title: November 6th, 2016 - IRC Case Competition
---

The IRC will be hosting its first case competition on November 6th, from 11AM-4PM.

The case competition offers interdisciplinary teams of Berkeley students to develop innovative solutions to the most pressing and significant problems in international relations and developmental politics. The case competition will engage UC Berkeley students on their creativity and analytical skills in a format not commonly found in international relations while also providing increased professional exposure for Berkeleyâ€™s international relations programs and the type of skills imparted on their students in an untraditional geographic location for international relations and development politics.
