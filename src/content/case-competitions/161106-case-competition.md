The case competition is a semesterly event where teams of 4-5 participants compete to solve a crisis or issue in the International arena. The IRC's case competition is modeled off of case competitions in the Business arena.


The purpose of the IRC's case competition is to teach competitiors about pertinent international issues and improve their critical thinking skills.


This year's case competition will be hosted on March 11, 2018 on UC Berkeley's Campus. This year's case competition will kick off UC Berkeley's International Relations week, a period of time for Cal students to find out about IR opportunities on campus and beyond.


Information will be coming shortly on the substantive facts of this semester's case competition.


Last term's case competition was hosted on November 5, 2017 at the ASUC Senate Chambers.
