March 17th, 2018 on UC Berkeley’s campus

The event will be a part of the International Relations week hosted by ASUC Senator Alexander Wilfert.

The topic will be announced **in early March.** The topic area will surround the issues of refugees and public health crisis.

All competitors will receive lunch and feedback from the judges

The case competition offers interdisciplinary teams of Berkeley students to develop innovative solutions to the most pressing and significant problems in international relations and developmental politics. The case competition will engage UC Berkeley students on their creativity and analytical skills in a format not commonly found in international relations while also providing increased professional exposure for Berkeley’s international relations programs and the type of skills imparted on their students in an untraditional geographic location for international relations and development politics.
