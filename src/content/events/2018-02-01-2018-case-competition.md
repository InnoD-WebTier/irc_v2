This year's case competition will be hosted on March 11, 2018 on UC Berkeley's Campus. Our competition is sponsored by the Office of ASUC senator Alexander Wilfert. This year's case competition will kick off UC Berkeley's International Relations week, a period of time for Cal students to find out about IR opportunities on campus and beyond.
